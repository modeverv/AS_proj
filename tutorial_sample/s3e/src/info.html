<p>S3E is an Amazon S3 client which allows you to manage buckets, and move files back and forth between your computer and Amazon S3.  In order to use S3E, you need to sign up for the Amazon S3 web service. Once you have your S3 access key and secret access key, click on the &quot;Account&quot; button to enter them.</p>

<p>Notes about the application:</p>

<ul>
  <li>To upload files, click on the &quot;Upload&quot; button, or drag files in from other applications. Multiple files can be uploaded or dragged at the same time.</li>
  <li>You can paste files in to S3E from the clipboard (only files are supported -- you can't paste other things like text).</li>
  <li>To download files, your best bet is to use the &quot;Download&quot; button. I don't have dragging out of the application fully working right now (it's a long story). In this version, if you drag a file out, you are actually dragging out a temporary URL to the file, so you can only drag files into applications which accept URLs (like your browser). I will hopefully have better support for dragging files out in a future version, but dragging and dropping files that reside on a remote system is a difficult problem to solve.</li>
  <li>S3E support keyboard copy/paste shortcuts, as well.</li>
</ul>
